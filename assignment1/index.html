                <p>So close, no matter how far
                   Couldn't be much more from the heart
                   Forever trusting who we are
                   And nothing else matters</p>
                
                <p>Never opened myself this way
                   Life is ours, we live it our way
                   All these words, I don't just say
                   And nothing else matters</p>

                <p>Trust I seek and I find in you
                   Every day for us something new
                   Open mind for a different view
                   And nothing else matters</p>

                <p>Never cared for what they do
                   Never cared for what they know
                   But I know</p>

                <p>So close, no matter how far
                   It couldn't be much more from the heart

                   And nothing else matters</p>

                <p>Never cared for what they do
                   Never cared for what they know

                <p>I never opened myself this way
                   Life is ours, we live it our way
